Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week: `How flexible it is with middleware. How to authenticate a token.`

Describe Middleware: `Code that "gets in the middle" of Express' normal operations. For example, code that checks an authentication token before something be executed is middleware.`

Describe a Resource: `Everything is a resource. In a RESTful API, resources are accessed via a unique URL and those resources are managed with HTTP methods.`

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful: `.status(200)`

How can we partition our application into sub-applications: `Routers!`
